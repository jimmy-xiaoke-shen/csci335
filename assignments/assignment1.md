This is our first assignment. It will **NOT** be graded. If you submit it on time, you can get full credit. The due time is June 2, 23: 59 (late submission policy, please check syllabus).


You can use your favoriate programming language to solve the problem.
Please include:
- Your student id (using id instead of name to protect your privacy).
- Time complexity and space complexity of your code.
- Add necessary comments on your code.


A sample submission can be here:
```cpp
/*
Studentd id:     0000
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complxity: O(1)
*/

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ret;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
            {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) 
                {
                    return {i, j};
                }
            }
        return ret;
    }
};
```


Submit format:
You can either 
- submit by using txt, word or screenshot of you ACed code.
