You can register the contest from [here](https://leetcode.com/contest/)

This saturday (May 29, 2021), we will have two contests:
- Biweekly Leetcode contest.
- Weekly Leetcode contest.
Check the detail schedule by yourself. Usually, it happens biweekly: 10:30 am to 12:00
weekly: 10:30 pm to 12:00.

You can earn credits from both contests.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 40 points.
- If you solve n problems, you can earn extra 10*n points.

Suppose you participate biweekly contest, and solve one problem
and you participate weekly contest, and solve zero problem, 
you will earn:
40 + 10 + 40 = 90 points
