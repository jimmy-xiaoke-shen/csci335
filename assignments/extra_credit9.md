- Weekly Leetcode contest.
Check the detail schedule by yourself. Usually, it happens biweekly: 10:30 am to 12:00
weekly: 10:30 pm to 12:00.

We increase the weights for correctly solving problems. Let's earn more credits and sharp your coding skills.

You can earn credits from both contests.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 20 points.
- If you solve n problems, you can earn extra 30\*n points.


For the proof of your participation, screenshot of the ranking page after the contest will 
be fine. Happy coding and good luck.

If you cannot make the LeetCode one, you can participate in the [atcoder abc](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc208)
It is on Saturday morning 8:00 am.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 20 points.
- If you solve n problems, you can earn extra 30\*n points.


If you have energy, you can participate in both and earn credits. However, you can only earn one time participation credit. Which means you will earn
20 + 30\*(number of problems solved from leetcode and atcoder).
