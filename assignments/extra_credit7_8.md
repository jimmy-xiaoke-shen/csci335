Check the detail schedule by yourself. Usually, it happens biweekly: 10:30 am to 12:00
weekly: 10:30 pm to 12:00.

We increase the weights for correctly solving problems. Let's earn more credits and sharp your coding skills.

You can earn credits from both contests.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 20 points.

be fine. Happy coding and good luck.

If you cannot make the LeetCode one, you can participate in the [atcoder abc](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc207)
It is on Saturday morning 8:00 am.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 20 points.
- If you solve n problems, you can earn extra 30\*n points.


If you have energy, you can participate in both and earn credits. However, you can only earn one time participation credit. Which means you will earn
20 + 30\*(number of problems solved from leetcode and atcoder).
